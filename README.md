# Tic_Tac_Toe
 Tic Tac Toe game using React



## DESCRIPTION

This program serves as an example of using React states to create interactivity. Player states, parent and child property inheritance, and rendering updates.


## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
This implementation currently allows players to override the other's tic marks. Adding in the ability to choose from a set number of three different size tick marks would make the game more like Goblet Gobblers, an excellent board game. This would also necessitate further updating the tic state of the squares as it would make checking the win condition more complicated. It would also require making a set amount of placeable tics of each size.
Further implementation of this feature could be to allow a player to pick up and replace their own already placed tics, which would reveal any tics that were covered up.
